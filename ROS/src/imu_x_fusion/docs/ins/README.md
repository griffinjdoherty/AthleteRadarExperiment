An **Inertial Navigation System (INS)** is a navigation device that uses a computer, 
motion sensors (**accelerometers**) and rotation sensors (**gyroscopes**) to continuously calculate 
by dead reckoning the position, the orientation, and the velocity (direction and speed of movement) 
of a moving object without the need for external references. 
Often the inertial sensors are supplemented by a **barometric altimeter** 
and occasionally by **magnetic sensors (magnetometers)** and/or speed measuring devices.
